Changes for release 0.87

Changed the flexreg confirmation link over-ride so that it works with Elgg 1.7.

Removed one last bit of experimental code accidentally left in for 0.86.

Fixed a bug that prevented completely deleting the content of a profile field
when a user edited a profile.

Form delete action now forwards to the correct page.

Deleting forms now also deletes any related search definitions.

Supported added for file attachments if the "attach" plugin is available.

Added access control to search forms.

There is an optional search box for content forms (only works for new content).

Added {$_guid} field to templates to provide form data guid

Added the ability to mail to user search results (needs the "message_queue" plugin).

Added an over-ride to the RSS group profileitems view to fix a bug in Elgg 1.7.

Over-rode some profile link views to prevent showing profile edit
links to logged-out users. (Seems to be a server-dependent core Elgg bug?)

Stopped adding a username field in the standard registration display if autousername
is turned on.

Added an option to turn off access boxes for user profile forms.

Added 'group_profile_category_'.str_replace(" ","_",$vars['entity']->group_profile_category
class to group icons div if group_profile_category is defined for that group. 
Eg. group_profile_category_mycategory
This makes it possible to set the icon through CSS depending upon the category.

Added 'user_profile_category_'.str_replace(" ","_",$vars['entity']->user_profile_category
class to user icons divs if user_profile_category is defined for that user. 
Eg. user_profile_category_mycategory
This makes it possible to set the icon through CSS depending upon the category.

In addition, added the icon size as a class for both group and user icon div wrappers.

Changes for release 0.86

Removed experimental code that was preventing form submits for some users.

Removed bad <? tag in "form/nav" view.

Added a 'groupprofile_preupdate' event so that plugins can look at the 
current and new group profile fields and refuse the update or carry out 
some other action.

Added a group description plugin hook so that plugins can append text below
the group description field.

Hid access controls for invisible fields.

Changes for release 0.85

Introduced flexreg plugin for registration forms

Added ability to assign a validation function for field definitions

Introduced templates for form display (currently only for registration forms,
but could be expanded)

Added a plugin setting for user content on the Elgg search page and turned it off by default.

Introduced group_configure plugin for more complex group category
configuration

Introduced group_messaging plugin

Checkbox searches should now work as expected.

Fixed a bug in the edit group form which displayed the wrong message
if the group already existed.

Stopped displaying profile data in the extended view if it is set 
to invisible (regardless of access level), unless the viewer is an admin.

Fixed a bug which occasionally unset admin-only fields.

The pages that list all fields no longer care about the user who created them.

Replaced input/longtext with form/input/longtext in several places
to avoid TinyMCE problems.

Turned off input filtering for the form, display and listing templates
so that they can contain arbitrary content.

Made flexgroupprofile work even if no group profile form is defined.

Added the ability to make group icons and descriptions mandatory

Now properly copies over an existing group icon if transferring the
group to a new owner.

Fixed a broken link on the orphan fields page.

Added a 'profilepreupdate' event so that plugins can look at the current and new profile
fields and refuse the update or carry out some other action.

Fixed the video box and image upload thumbnail display.

Added the ability to display three thumbnail sizes for image
uploads:

{$my_field_name:thumb:tiny} (60x60)
{$my_field_name:thumb:small} (153x153)
{$my_field_name:thumb:large} (600x600)

Added clarification to README.txt that image upload works only with 
the file plugin activated.

Changes for release 0.8.4

Fixed several display problems with flexfile.

Creating new groups should work properly with flexgroupprofile.

Added new private groups option (introduced in Elgg 1.6) to flexgroup profile.
This has not been tested so I would appreciate feedback on that.

Changes for release 0.8.3

Fixed some weirdness in the display of the orientation option 
for when editing radio button and checkbox group definitions.
This should now display consistently.

Removed the is_keyword option as it did not do anything (in Elgg 1.x
metadata is always searchable if you have the right access level).

Fixed the display of checkbox groups (previously these would only
display properly if only one had been selected).

Added a $_friendlytime template variable.

Fixed several problems with the group profile display and added a
"wide tabbed" display for groups that need more room for their profile
information.

Changes for release 0.8.2

Required fields for content forms are now working again.

Added some protection against the metadata case bug:
http://trac.elgg.org/elgg/ticket/639

I may have accidentally left a debugging statement in 
extended profile views in the last release  (not sure, but 
this release definitely does not have it.)

Changes for release 0.8.1

Default field access levels should now work properly.

Moving fields repeatedly up and down now works.

Skype, MSN and ICQ contact fields now display a text box (and render just as
text as well - some decoration will be added in a future release).
 
Flexgroupprofiles now always have a description field and use the one the
group already has if available.
 
Custom templates should now show all the values in tag and checkbox fields 
(previously they showed only one).
